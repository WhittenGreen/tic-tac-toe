# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe built using React
## I would like to add the below functionality to the board as I learn more:
I would like to implement a way to prevent the same square from being clicked. I would also like to remove the winner is: language until there actually is a winner. 
I would make a square that it would add a condition that if square is clicked, then it cannot be clicked again until state is refreshed. This would prevent any square from being changed. 
removing the winner sentence would simply take a requirement of adding some additional conditionals. Adding an if statement that says if a winner is found then print to the DOM the winner is player: message using a mount.
